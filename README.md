# DnD-Characters
This is a side project I decided to work on as I recently saw how many dnd character sheets I have printed out creating a small pile up of paper for a few characters. I wanted to create a small web app which I can use to easily & quickly view and create characters on for the times I sometimes forget to bring my sheets to a session or just for easy viewing.

This web app is hopefully going to be fully built using the Netlify CMS to add characters, created using HTML, CSS & JS languages. 

It is currently being hosted via Netlify at this link: https://dazzling-sammet-3b915d.netlify.app/
As I have developed this for mobile I would suggest changing the screen resolution.
